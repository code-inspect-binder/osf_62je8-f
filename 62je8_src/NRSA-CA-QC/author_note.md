# Note

On 17 March 2021, I (David Murray-Stoker) was working on another project using data from the National Rivers and Streams Assessment 2008-2009 data. When going through data checking, I noticed there were 821 more rows of raw invertebrate data (old file = 1300 rows, current file = 2121 rows) and 123 rows in the data for analysis (old file = 941 rows, new file = 1064 rows). I do not have an explanation for the difference in rows. I had the original data since 2017 when I began working on the project, but no rows or columns were removed from the dataset prior to analysis. Given the large difference in the datasets, I proceeded to re-analyze the entire datasets to determine if results are still supported (i.e., quality check or "QC"").

All analyses were conducted as reported in the text, including model training on the boosted regression trees. As different data were being used, assuming the same model parameters would have been incorrect. Re-analysis of the data confirmed that the results and interpretations in the manuscript are still supported, with the primary difference being the exact values, not meaning or interpretation, of test statistics, P-values, and sums of relative influence for drivers of community assembly.
